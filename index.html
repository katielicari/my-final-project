          <p>On May 20, 2018, Louise Graham, 52, was assaulted by her partner. Around 8 p.m., officers responded to a 911 call at their home on Towne Avenue. According to police records, Louise  had been beaten by Edward Jamal Rubin. There was no arrest. Exactly one week later, Louise was dead. According to the coroner’s report, she was beaten, drowned, and eventually, strangled with an electrical cord.</p>

          <p>Rubin was arrested and charged with murder but awaits trial. Louise’s assault was one of 19,343 domestic violence incidents LAPD responded to in 2018. Her death was one of 22 homicides with domestic violence attributed as a motive, although these numbers are most likely an undercount. According to numerous studies, one in three women will experience sexual or physical intimate-partner violence, a subset of domestic violence, in their lifetimes.

                The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that domestic or intimate-partner violence is a motive in 16% of all homicides. In 2018, domestic violence homicides made up 8.5% of homicides in Los Angeles, the highest rate on record since 2015, according to an analysis of LAPD data. (The data goes back to 2010, but the definition of rape and sexual violence changed in 2014, so a comparison to previous years isn’t equitable.) Some years, domestic-violence motivated homicide rates were as low as 2.5% (2015) or 3.5% (2020). In every year analyzed, the LAPD has undercounted domestic violence homicides in comparison to actual arrest data reported to the California Department of Justice.

           <p>The events leading up to Louise Graham’s murder aren’t unusual. In fact, an analysis of LAPD data, reveals that the circumstances of her case are typical of domestic violence incidents in L.A., including police response. Her story highlights the deadly consequences of LAPD’s failure to respond to domestic and intimate-partner violence in the city of Los Angeles.</p>
            
            <p>
            2018 was a particularly violent year for women (and persons who identify as female) in L.A.  with the highest rates of domestic violence homicide and femicide in the preceding five years. According to a National Domestic Violence Hotline survey, 75% of survivors of intimate-partner violence surveyed nationwide said the current 911 and law enforcement response was ineffective or made them feel less safe. One quarter of survivors surveyed stated they would not contact law enforcement in the future about their abuse and more than half said that contacting the police made their situations worse. 22% said they felt like they were discriminated against by law enforcement due to their race.

                <p>In Los Angeles, Black and Latino women are most likely to be victims in a domestic and or intimate-partner violence incident. However, Black women are three times more likely to be a victim than all other racial/ethnic groups. In addition, when Black victims, like Louise Graham, call the police, an arrest is only made half the time compared, the lowest rates among all racial/ethnic groups.. In 2020, the arrest rate for domestic violence incidents with a Black victim actually decreased from 17% to 15%. Even before the pandemic, though, arrest rates were down across all racial/ethnic groups, averaging around 30% for white , Latino and Asian women. </p>

                  The officers who responded to the assault a week before Graham’s death noted the force used against her. Despite this, the assault was classified as a simple assault, a misdemeanor. According to LAPD domestic violence unit detectives with the Harbor bureau, it’ department  policy to only make an arrest in misdemeanor cases when the suspect is still at the scene and to make no additional effort to track down the suspect. Strikingly, Black victims are most likely to have assaults classified as a felony but are half as likely to have those felonies lead to arrest of the perpetrator. However, this isn’t a contributing factor in prosecutions because of another LAPD policy. The decision to press charges in domestic or intimate-partner violence situations is in the hands of law enforcement and not contingent upon a cooperative victim.

                  According to detectives in LAPD they do not track internally the impacts of domestic violence on specific communities such as by race or gender, they only track by precinct.

                  “We believe the majority of [victims are] female but we don't know specifically, how many of our reports are female, how many are male and then the same thing with by race.” said Detective Rea Garconela with the Harbor Precinct.

            <p>
            There are other aspects of Graham’s case, aside from race,  which indicate how LAPD mishandles domestic violence assault and homicides. Graham was murdered in the 18th precinct, which has the highest incidence rate of domestic violence-motivated homicides in the city. She lived in the Southeast Los Angeles precinct, which has the highest rate of reported domestic violence incidents and the second lowest arrest rate among all 21 LAPD precincts, half the average arrest rate for all other precincts.

            <h4 class=muted>Intervention Programs</h4>
            <p>
            LAPD has a program called the DART Program set up as a response system for domestic violence calls. This program, rolled out system-wide in 2015, pairs a specially trained officer with domestic violence advocates to be first responders in domestic violence calls. The team only responds to calls four days a week (Thursday through Sunday) and requires 10 hours of training per year, although they are given the opportunity to receive more training. The advocate receives 40 hours per year. 
            </p>
            
            <p class="lead purple">
            “DART Officers are the domestic violence expert at those divisions. So either patrol officers that have questions, or sometimes investigators, you can go to them to ask for more information.” According to Detective Maria Cervantes, a domestic violence coordinator for LAPD. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
            The DART program seeks to serve domestic violence survivors in a more holistic way, such as connecting survivors with support services and housing, mental health counseling for survivors and children. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
            An evaluation of the DART pilot program stated that the program overall increased trust in police to handle domestic violence cases but it is underutilized due to the limited days of availability. The limited hours in the program still exist and have not been expanded. The report also stated that there were staffing issues due to little enthusiasm on the part of LAPD officers. According to NO DV LA, a special program of the Mayor’s office which funds the DART Program, 6000 survivors are served annually by DART response teams. 

            </p>
            
            <p>
            In its current phase only 16 precincts, of the LAPD’s 21, have a community partner agency working with them. These agencies are critical to connecting survivors with resources beyond what law enforcement can provide. The Southeast precinct, who responded to Louise Graham’s assault, is one of the precincts without a community partner.
